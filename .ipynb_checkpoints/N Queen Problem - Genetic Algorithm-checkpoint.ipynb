    "Description:\n",
    "The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard. (Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle )\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge:\n",
    "The challenge is to generate one right sequence through Genetic Programming. The sequence has to be 8 numbers between 0 to 7. Each number represents the positions the Queens can be placed. Each number refers to the row number in the specific column\n",
    "\n",
    "0 3 4 5 6 1 2 4\n",
    "\n",
    "· 0 is the row number in the column 0 where the Queen can be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "· 3 is the row number in the column 1 where the Queen can be placed\n",
